    <h2>My Assessment</h2> <!--Hey Thomas!-->
    <img src="assets/img/content-image2.jpg">
    <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
    <div class="alert">
      <p>This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
    </div>
    <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>
    <h4>Explain the difference between the &quot;alt&quot; attribute and the &quot;title&quot; attribute. </h4>
    <p>The title attribute gives the user extra information about an element. The alt attribute shows alternate text for an element for accessibility purposes or if an image can't be displayed.</p>
    <h4>Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary</h4>
    <p>The following code snippet:</p>
    <p class="snippet">
      &lt;p><code>&lt;dfn>&lt;abbr>HTML&lt;/abbr>(hypertext markup language)&lt;/dfn>is a description language used to structure documents on the web.</code>&lt;/p>
    </p>
    <p>Will produce this result:</p>
    <p>
      <dfn><abbr>HTML</abbr>(hypertext markup language)</dfn>
      is a description language used to structure documents on the web.
